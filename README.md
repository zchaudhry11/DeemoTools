<h3>Current Features:</h3>

<h4>-Extended Resolution Support-</h4>
<p>This tool uses the magic of third-rate computer programming to dynamically patch Deemo's memory when you run the game in order to add support for resolutions that are not supported out of the box such as Ultrawide and 4K. To use this, launch Deemo, assign the desired resolution in the tool (you will notice your game is now zoomed in or out), press Alt + Enter to toggle window mode and force a refresh and now the game should work perfectly in the new resolution. Note: This does not persist when exiting the game since future game updates can potentially break this functionality since the memory is patched directly and I didn't want my tool to break peoples' games.</p>

<h4>-Custom Key Mapping-</h4>
<p>Were you excited to play Deemo on PC only to realize that the default keys cannot be rebound? If so, you're out of luck because this tool doesn't let you rebind the keys either. Instead, you can soft map other keys to mimic the in-game binds and toggle those binds on or off with a checkbox to simulate key rebinding. There is also a slider to control the poll rate if enabling the key binds causes frame drops for you.</p>

<h4>-Global BGM and Key Volume Setting-</h4>
<p>This tool allows you to assign the BGM and Key sound volumes for all songs that have been played at least one time via two sliders. This is useful for people that want the same audio settings across every song but do not want to manually set them one by one. It also allows you to set the volume to 0 which cannot be done in-game which is useful for people that want to completely mute the key sound that plays when activating notes.</p>

<h4>-One Click Save Backups-</h4>
<p>Some people have reported having their save games corrupted so I figured it would be useful to have a button that backs up all of your save slots to a timestamped folder in case you ever need to recover your saves and Steam Cloud fails you. You can access these by navigating to AppData\LocalLow\Rayark\DEEMO -Reborn-\profiles</p>

<h4>-Localized in English and Japanese-</h4>
<p>My third-rate tool has also been translated to Third-Rate Japanese™</p>

**Instructions:**
Download the latest release from the releases section and run DeemoTools.exe from any location. Windows might report it as a suspicious executable due to the nature of the program however it is not malicious. From there, you can adjust the resolution, binds, volume, change the tool language, or make save backups. DeemoTools.exe also creates a small config file that persists the tool's previous settings when you close the application; this file is located in the same directory as the save games and is negligible in size.

**Resolution Guide:**
1. Launch Deemo
2. Press Alt + Tab to switch to the tool and select a resolution from the dropdown (only supported Windows resolutions are shown)
3. Click the Set Resolution button
4. Press Alt + Tab to go back to the game, everything should be zoomed in or out
5. Press Alt + Enter to toggle windowed mode and force the game to refresh, everything should be working now

**Soft Keybind Guide:**
1. Set your desired keybinds for each rhythm lane
2. Before playing a song, press Alt + Tab to go to the tool and check the "Enable Custom Binds" box
3. When not playing a song or tabbing out of the game, you should uncheck the same box otherwise the binds will continue to take effect

**Volume Guide:**
1. Move the sliders to the desired volume values
2. Press the "Set Volume" button
3. This edits your save games and adjusts the volume for all songs which have currently been played at least once. If you are in-game, you may need to reload your save file to see the changes.

If anybody from Rayark sees this, tell Alvin and the front-end team I said "wazzup." ~~Also feel free to send me a giant Mandora and other free merchandise since I can't purchase them online.~~
